## Introduction

### Motivation

The idea for this application stems from the personal experience, making the
application of exchange program. I had to choose 15 at maximum universities
among more than 80 ones. Checking the suitability, such as English
requirements and Course restrictions, for each university and every conditions
consumed long time repeatedly. I though that handling the huge number of cells
and sites could be effeciently processed through an information system. By
reducing the redundant non-judgemental operations can be beneficial to make an
clear and well-informed decision.

### Problem Statement

Determining whether I can apply this university or not is simple task but takes
long time. Every comparision of my English test score, major and other static
information with the other universities' qualifications are procedeed on hands
and eyes. Furthermore, some of qualifications are more detail than others, which
makes it difficult to comparing the numbers only.

When making an order of applicable universities in my preference, my relative
criterias are changed time to time. It delays the entire decision and often
affects other criterias. In addition, because of the ambiguity, the final order
is eventually decided in qualitative and relative manner.

The fact information of all universities are located in their own website, which
makes hard to collect in a single format and compare amone them. Opening web pages
and searching the requiring information also consumes time and is done
repeatedly.
